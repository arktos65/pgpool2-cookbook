# ----------------------------
# pgPool-II configuration file
# ----------------------------
#
# This file consists of lines of the form:
#
#   name = value
#
# Whitespace may be used.  Comments are introduced with "#" anywhere on a line.
# The complete list of parameter names and allowed values can be found in the
# pgPool-II documentation.
#
# This file is read on server startup and when the server receives a SIGHUP
# signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have to SIGHUP the
# server for the changes to take effect, or use "pgpool reload".  Some
# parameters, which are marked below, require a server shutdown and restart to
# take effect.
